# August 2025 Jane Street Puzzle – Attempt 1

## Initial Impressions

This puzzle featured nine dogs, each holding two poker cards. Eight of the dogs’ hands were visible, and one hand was hidden. Each dog also had a unique facial expression (emoji-style), which was presumably post-river.

At first glance, the challenge seemed to be reverse-engineering the flop-turn-river based on their visible hands and emotional responses. I assumed that if I could find a board that made sense of all the moods and hands, I could then deduce the hidden hand.

## My Approach

### Step 1: List All Known Hands and Moods

I started by cataloging:
- Each visible hand (two hole cards)
- Their mood (e.g., “confident,” “fearful,” “hopeful,” etc.)

From there, I tried to reason what kind of community cards could cause those moods. For instance:
- Blissful/content dogs → likely hit strong hands
- Angry/frustrated dogs → may have missed draws
- Fearful/surprised → possibly beaten by unexpected hands

### Step 2: Attempted to Reconstruct the Board

I assumed the river was known to all players and caused the emotional shift.

I tried to:
- Simulate likely boards (flop, turn, river) that would result in these emotional shifts.
- Consider the combinations of hands that would result in straights, flushes, top pair, two pair, etc.

This turned out to be very complex, with multiple plausible boards for certain groupings, but always one or two hands/emotions that didn’t quite fit.

## Sticking Points

Despite multiple board attempts, I couldn’t find a river that matched **all** emotions and made logical poker sense. Some emotions (like “confident” on a weak hand) felt impossible to rationalize, unless there was deeper deception.

At this point, I started questioning:
> Was the poker interpretation a red herring?

But I was too committed to the card logic route to explore alternatives at this stage.

## What I Assumed (Incorrectly)

- That the puzzle was about poker logic and board-building.
- That emotions mapped directly to the strength of each player's final hand.
- That the answer would emerge from deduction over the game state.

## Closing Thoughts (At Time of Attempt)

I believed I was close, maybe a few logical steps or emotional mappings away. I hadn't considered decoding the emojis as a direct cipher or code. In retrospect, this was a major blind spot in my thinking.

At the time of this attempt, I had **not** discovered the actual solution or seen any online help. This was my honest thought process up to the point of getting stuck.
